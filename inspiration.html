        <div class="swim">
            <h5>Swimming</h5>
        Swimming is an activity that I thoroughly enjoy, whether it's taking laps in a pool or 
          exploring the open waters of a nearby lake or ocean. I appreciate the full-body workout 
          that swimming provides and the low-impact nature of the exercise, which is gentle on my 
          joint. In addition, the relaxing sensation of weightlessness in the water provides a 
          meditative quality that can be incredibly soothing and rejuvenating.
        </div>
        <div class="gym">
            <h5>Gym</h5>
         As a regular member of the Gym, I have access to a variety of workout options that I 
          enjoy exploring. I love trying out different fitness programs, attending yoga classes, 
          and lifting weights, among other things. The community aspect of exercising at the Gym 
          is also something that I appreciate, as I get to meet and connect with like-minded people
           who share my passion for fitness and wellness.
        </div>
        <div class="volley-ball">
            <h5>volley-ball</h5>
        Playing volleyball is another hobby that I love. It is a high-energy sport that requires 
            quick reflexes, coordination, and teamwork. Working together with my teammates to set 
            up plays and score points is a challenge that I relish, and the social aspect of playing 
            volleyball is another highlight for me. Not only is it a fun way to get an excellent 
            cardiovascular workout, but it is also a great way to spend time with friends.

           The positive impact of my hobby on my mental health is something that I have also noticed. 
          Engaging in these physical activities helps me clear my mind and reduce anxiety, and 
          the release of endorphins during exercise is a mood-booster that keeps me feeling great.
         Overall, swimming, exercising at the Gym, and playing volleyball are integral parts of my 
         hobby that keep me feeling physically and mentally balanced. I cannot imagine my life with
         out these activities and the joy that they bring me.
